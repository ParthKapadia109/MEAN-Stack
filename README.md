# Role Management

## Description
This project is a full-stack web application built using **Angular** for the front-end and **Node.js** for the back-end. The application aims to provide a seamless experience for users to interact with the system through a responsive and dynamic user interface.

## Tech Stack

### Front-End
- **Angular**: A platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript.

### Back-End
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine used for building fast and scalable network applications.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database to store application data.

### Optional Add-Ons (if applicable)
- **Chart.js**: For rendering interactive charts (if needed).
- **JWT Authentication**: For secure user authentication and authorization.

## Features
- **Responsive UI**: The front-end dynamically adapts to different screen sizes for mobile and desktop views.
- **RESTful API**: The Node.js back-end exposes a REST API to communicate with the front-end and manage data.
- **User Authentication**: (If applicable) Secure user authentication using JWT.
- **Real-time Updates**: (If applicable) Real-time data updates using websockets or long polling.

## Installation
